Introduction / Business Problem

Hostels are inexpensive hotels or inns that generally cater to budget travelers.
Often located in major cities or around tourist sites, they feature basic accommodations and cheap rates.
As a site for people from around the world to gather and save money,
a backpacking hostel tends to feature less in the way of formal hospitality and more with regards to
organized activities and building a communal spirit.

The ideal location of a hostel should be a place with a high volume of budget travelers passing through.
It should be easily accessible, travelers may not know their way around the area, and able to compete with others,
if any, hostels in the region. It should also be close to major touristic attractions in a city.

The objective of this project is to find a good location for a new hostel in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, using Foursquare
data to support this decision.

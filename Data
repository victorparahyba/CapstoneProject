DATA

Three different types of venues will be considered to find a good location for this new hostel in Sao Paulo:

- Tourist attractions that have more reviews (top 10);
- Cheap restaurants and supermarkets;
- Presence of other hostels.

The fist two criterias will increase the rank of the area while the third one will decrease.

Foursquare data of the venues will be used to acquire this information, while a ranking weighting algorithm based on the criteria will
be developed to investigate the good locations for the new business.
